## Mission Statement
To cultivate a social, self-improving, prosperity striving life to use my ever-improving knowledge and tenets to contribute to change for and beyond the tech world. Specifically, to make the best software options *egalitarian* and *liberating*.
 - Egalitarian: in an access, and free non-monetizable state 
 - Liberating: in a transparent, reusable, fixable, configurable, extensible, and interoperable state.

## Manifesto
Technology is an extension of us, it's often how we spend our time and interface with reality. But no matter how much closed source software is interwoven into our workflows, industry, infrastructure, culture and society, if there is a better open source alternative people should value and choose to use it instead closed source software. 

Your attention is your freedom.
The Bourgeoisie sold us exploitation of our attention as convenience, that's how we got the modern internet. We've been torn apart and weakened by it.

    **Adam Sessions:**
    I agree that the rich and powerful are attacking and exploiting the people by forcing us to be dependent on their software. That is a great point towards your argument.


There is a brazen, perverse business culture permeating silicon valley; to soothe trap and coerce you, to make you rely addicted and dependent on there software. The oligarchs sell the culture as natural product of capitalism to aspiring innovators to use and crush them into shareholder profit. Elites make proprietary software to trap you in an ecosystem and monopolize. The dialectical irony of late-stage capitalism, as a monopolistic plutocracy, makes me sick.

    **Adam Sessions**
    Although I agree that the monopoly that certain companies hold over the american people in specific is harmful because it allows them to me idle in their innovations,but it might be worth mentioning that it is a lack of competition in the market that allows them to create a terrible product and still profit off of it, in my opinion the only way to force these companies to innovate is to light a metaphorical fire under their asses.

Then, once software is made, distributing copies has no manufacturing or delivery price, we have a post-scarcity simulacrum, yet half of it's built by companies that sell there software.
Selling still works without scarcity here. When something doesn't exist yet, demand for it isn't rewarded with free access, cause you can't access what doesn't exist yet. And further still software can be made hard for the purchasers to distribute, this is because the user won't fully own the product, just a license to use it, often done so with an account connecting to a server meaning clients can even use the product without internet.

But even the companies that make closed source programs do and need to rely on open source to make progress, because whilst an idea innovates something can only be last as a standard when it's open. For example, OBS, VLC, Blender, Godot and 7-zip, Linux servers, git, HTML5, HTTPS, IP, JSON, PDF, CSV, DOCX, OAuth, MPEG, SQL, are all thriving, the list is endless.



Innovation is the manifestation of new. What’s new won’t last if it can’t be built off of, open source allows for this in a way no other technology can. 
Do not misunderstand, an everyday user can try to help and make things worse, because the barrier to entry on volunteer work is none, and whilst this is a [real issue](https://gist.github.com/g1eny0ung/9e7d4d0f72547a8d156452e76fa8f7a3) open source obviously has been working, it just means the real innovations live in third party forks not third party pull requests. Things are best made as coordinated groups (sometimes just one very *dedicated* person) and it isn't the volunteers job to decide where to take a project unless they fork the project and make it there own. 

Linux isn’t a the best operating system for it’s price, it’s a the best period, it’s not even close. If you want an online presence, coding one in HTML is easy and hosting is free and works anywhere, even if it was 1000 times harder and expensive, it would still be better than ever selling your soul to a social media platform. 

The time that I have saved leaving social media has far exceeded the time spent learning and creating a website, and I'm better for it. I have more skills, Practice creativity more. More control over my data. I can delete a webpage, edit it, revert changes, any file type I can host and present it in any format.
I don't expect people to often view my website, it has a Rss/Atom feed that alerts people when there are updates or sometimes within the feed provides all of the content to the viewers without having to check my page at all.

This is way even when open source lags behind, it always wins out.

# Rule of Life
take back your attention and repurpose it the 4 following tenets
 - **Relations**. Cultivate connections with God, family, friends, and community. Build a strong support network to counteract societal atomization.
 - **Self**. Understand who you are, be who you are, and make yourself the best version of yourself as possible. Work on your Education, Physical/Mental Health, Id/Ego.
 - **Prosperity**. Both you and society must prosper, this means having the capital to be secure in a comfortable life, if you continue to accrue capital beyond this point strategically allocate it back to community to maximize aid.
 - **Production**. Find some change that you can create/contribute to that you want for everyone that you find fulfilling creating/contributing too.
---
 - If some software or platform collects data on you, is closed source, costs money, or works of some add revenue model, then throw it out of your life unless strictly necessary. (No social media isn't necessary.)
    **Adam Sessions:**
    I agree that social media has harmful effects on your productivity and there are plenty of studies that prove that, but it might be worth noting that it isnt necessary to cut it out of your life entirly, rather to limit your use and limit what you post to what you would tell a large croud. As well as most of the data harvesting that goes on in social media platforms is to give you ads intending to sell you a product. As long as you have control over your spending habits I can see no problem with the company knowing what kind of cell phone you own or other non-personal info.

 - Use software that is made for you and not for a company to profit off you.
 - Make a website, even if you don't know how to create one, just go to neocities.org or nekoweb.org and you can upload any file you want to be public there, and send people links to the files.
